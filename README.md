# Pet-project: Cinemania

https://andriitsokur.github.io/pet-cinemania/

## Brief Description

This was originally a team project at the end of the Vanilla JavaScript
education block at the GoIT school (https://goit.global) - my classmates and I
successfully completed it almost a year ago.

However, the implementation of some parts of the project didn't quite suit me,
and now, having some free time, I decided it was a good chance to completely
redo the project by myself using the ready-made Figma layout, ReactJS and
Vanilla CSS (the last one is just for fun).

So, here we are!

## Features

- You can check out a list of the latest trending and upcoming movies, get brief
  information about them and watch their official trailers.
- The "Catalogue" section includes a complete list of movies from the TMDB
  collection (https://www.themoviedb.org/) - a search function by movie title is
  also included.
- Finally, you can save (or remove) cards of your favorite movies in the Library
  (and filter them by genre) without any registration - this data will be stored
  in your local storage.

Enjoy!

## Used Technologies

- Mobile First adaptive and responsive markup
- CSS modules
- Material Design UI library for some elements
